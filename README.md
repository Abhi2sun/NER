Named Entity Recognition (NER) using RoBERTa on CoNLL-2003 Dataset
This repository implements a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model using the pre-trained RoBERTa language model fine-tuned on the CoNLL-2003 dataset. The CoNLL-2003 dataset is widely used for NER tasks, containing labeled entities in English text such as PER (person), ORG (organization), LOC (location), and MISC (miscellaneous).

Overview
NER is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where the objective is to identify and classify entities in text into predefined categories. Using a transformer-based model like RoBERTa, we can capture rich contextual information from the surrounding text, significantly improving the performance of NER over traditional models.

This repository provides a streamlined implementation to fine-tune RoBERTa for NER using the Hugging Face Transformers library, which makes it easy to integrate pre-trained language models into downstream tasks.

Features
Pre-trained Language Model: RoBERTa, a robustly optimized BERT model, is fine-tuned for NER, allowing for high accuracy on the CoNLL-2003 dataset.
End-to-End Pipeline: Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.
Evaluation Metrics: Precision, recall, and F1-score metrics are computed to assess the model's performance on the NER task.
Flexible and Extensible: Easily adaptable to other NER datasets and transformer models (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT).
Dataset
The CoNLL-2003 dataset contains labeled sentences in English with four entity categories:

PER: Person names
ORG: Organizations
LOC: Locations
MISC: Miscellaneous entities that don't fit into the other categories
The dataset format includes tokens and their respective entity tags, and it is provided as a sequence labeling problem.

Model Architecture
The model uses RoBERTa as a base encoder, fine-tuned on the token-level NER task:
#if needed to optimize we can 
RoBERTa encodes each token in the input sequence, creating contextual embeddings.
A classification head (linear layer) maps each token embedding to one of the entity classes.
CRF (optional): A Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer can be added to enforce sequence-level dependencies, improving the model's ability to produce valid entity sequences.
